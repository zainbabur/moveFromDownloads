# moveFromDownloads
A simple bash script which lets you clean up your downloads folder by moving files. The syntax will be moveFromDownloads <file extension> <directory>. It will move all files having the said extension to the directory of your choice. For example, you might want to move all your mp3 files to music folder, in that case the syntax will be moveFromDownloads mp3 Music. If the directory does not exist, it will ask you if you want to create the directory, and then create it for you if you choose so.

Keep this file in your home directory and make it executable by running chmod +x moveFromDownloads in terminal so that you will be able to use it as a simple linux command.
